I'm a Health Policy & Management PhD candidate at Harvard Business School interested in competition and innovation, with a particular topic focus on the pharmaceutical industry and prescription drug policy. 

I will be on the academic job market in Fall 2025.

***Job Market Paper:*** **Policy Incentives and Pharmaceutical Innovation** (*Draft coming*)
<details}

<summary>*Abstract:* This project explores how policy-driven market expectations influence drug innovation in two ways.</summary> First, we estimate the causal effects of extending market exclusivity for antibiotics, a critical drug class where the social value of new antibiotics likely exceeds private returns. Our identification approach leverages the enactment of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act, which granted five additional years of exclusivity for antibiotics but not other infectious disease products like antivirals or vaccines. We use a difference-in-differences approach comparing antibiotic products (treatment) to antiviral and vaccine products (control) to estimate the effect of the GAIN Act on innovative activity at multiple stages of drug development: patenting, pre-clinical activity, and progression through clinical trials.

The second component of this project develops a model of drug development that allows us to (1) generalize our findings beyond anti-infective therapeutic classes, and (2) discuss counterfactual policies to stimulate drug innovation. We use drug-level data on pre-clinical development decisions and observed revenues for approved drugs to take a simulated method of moments approach to calibrate parameters governing the anticipated market size and net present value of drugs in development. Using these parameter estimates, we then consider a range of counterfactual policies, including patent reform, direct price negotiation akin to the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, and less traditional proposals like advance market commitments.
